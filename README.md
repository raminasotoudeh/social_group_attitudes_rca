# social_group_attitudes_rca
Replication data and code for "Party, Race, and Neutrality: Investigating the Interdependence of Attitudes Towards Social Groups." 
To efficiently run the code, use the "Source.R" file. 
Note that some of the code--step 4 (running RCA) and especially step 9 (supplementary analyses) in the Source file--is computationally intensive.
